FIT CTU - 17/18 - FI-KSA (Cultural and Social Anthropology)

## Course overview
The one-semester course aims to acquaint students with the basics of social and cultural anthropology as a scientific discipline dealing with the diversity of the world - examples from anthropological research from our "exotic" cultures (topics: kinship, religion, social exclusion, migration, globalization, material culture, language, health, history, death, etc ...) will be shown. The course is an interesting alternative to other humanities, taught at FIT.

## Goals
The goal of this subject was to create a reflection of a chosen lectured theme.
